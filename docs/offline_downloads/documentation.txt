       1. What is secretrandom
       As you might have known from the package's description, secretrandom is unpredictable random number generation,
       credential, and token generation. Hence the name "secretrandom", the combination of the random module and the secrets
       module with its function to generate random numbers, and cryptographic tokens respectively.

       secrets utilizes random's SystemRandom() class which is random but great in unpredictability considering the "high-quality
       sources from the operating system." according to Python's secrets documentation.

       In secretrandom, the package features SystemRandom(), but not its unpredictability. secretrandom uses repetition utilizing
       for loops with random ranges (a random number of times the for loops has to repeat), resulting in different values
       SystemRandom() returns. If you were able to predict a random number returned by SystemRandom() verses
       secretrandom's number, secretrandom wins in unpredictability.

       It ain't just random numbers that secretrandom is, from character generation to token generation to random shuffles. Believe
       it or not, secretrandom will be lifechanging for programmers, simple, super-rapid, and lightweight.


       2. Installation
       Open your operating system's CLI terminal (CMD, Powershell, etc.) and input:

       python -m pip install secretrandom

       After secretrandom is installed sucessfully, be sure the right version is installed by printing secretrandom.ver() in your
       Python terminal (with secretrandom imported)

       >>> import secretrandom as sr
       >>> print(sr.ver())

            randchar()

            Generates a random character based on int: length (1st argument)

            import secretrandom
            password = secretrandom.randchar(1)
            print(password) # Prints out a random character

            Print multiple characters to makeup a password.

            password = secretrandom.randchar(17)
            print(password) # Prints out multiple characters like a password

            randcode()

            Generates passcodes or PINs based on the length as

            passcode = secretrandom.randcode(6)
            print(passcode) # Prints out passcode with 6 integers

            product_id()

            Generates product IDs or product keys based on the length as the only argument.

            product_key = secretrandom.product_id(5)
            print(product_key) # Prints out product ID with 5 segments ('2ZKDF-6RYHM-QUKVG-JJYRZ-GQ2D5')

            randint()

            Random whole integer generator starting from 1st arg to 2nd arg with steps (3rd arg)

            random_num = secretrandom.randint(1, 4)
            print(random_num) # Prints out a number between 1-4

            OR

            random_num = secretrandom.randint(1, 6, 2)
            print(random_num) # Prints out a number either 2, 4, or 6

            randflt()

            Random float generator from 1st arg to 2nd arg

            random_flt = secretrandom.randflt(1, 2)
            print(random_flt) # Prints out random float from 1 to 2 (like 1.673)

            choice()

            Chooses part of a list of values.

            choice = secretrandom.choice('abcd')
            print(choice) # Prints out what it chose (either a, b, c, or d)

            shuffle()

            Shuffles a list of values.

            data = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
            secretrandom.shuffle(data)
            print(data) # Shuffles the list of values.
